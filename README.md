# Speak-Word-Meaning-with-Python

Welcome to the Speaking Word Meanings with Python project! This project demonstrates how to use Python to speak out the meanings of words using text-to-speech technology. By leveraging libraries such as PyDictionary and pyttsx3, users can easily explore the meanings of words in a dynamic and interactive way.

## Libraries Used for Text-to-Speech

This project utilizes the following libraries for text-to-speech functionality:

1. **pyttsx3**: `pyttsx3` is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. It provides support for multiple TTS engines and offers a simple interface for converting text into spoken words.

2. **PyDictionary**: `PyDictionary` is a Python library used for fetching word meanings from online dictionaries. It provides a convenient way to access word definitions programmatically, which are then spoken using `pyttsx3`.

These libraries work together seamlessly to enable the project to speak out the meanings of words in an interactive and engaging manner.
